# Prototype Rally
Twitter: [@Dmitrix_](https://twitter.com/dmitrix_)


This is a personal challenge to create a new playable game prototype ~~every week.~~ as often as possible.

## Why?
A new game every week?! Sounds crazy, right? It is. Fortunately I'm not the first to try something like this. 
According to many prominent game developers, not only is rapid prototyping an essential skill but it is also the only way to gain experience. Below are links to articles, videos and even an NYU course that describes the challenge of making a game every week.

## Rules

* **Don't don't break the chain**

While I feel like "[don't break the chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)" challenges can be very motivating, breaking a long chain can be devastating and hard to recover from. A little over a year ago I held a sizable commit streak on GitHub. However, there came a day when I just didn't have time to sit at a computer and make a commit. After that, my contribution rate plummeted and I was programming less. Interestingly, since then [GitHub has removed contribution graph statistics](http://erik.io/blog/2016/04/01/how-github-contribution-graph-is-harmful/) but the graph it self is still there. Anyways, while the challenge may techincally be to make a game *every* week, it's not going to be the end of the world if I miss a week. Some times I'm going to need a week off, as long as I get right back to it the next week. The more important thing is that the list under **Completed** continues to grow with time.

* **Write down what has been learned**

The whole point of this is to learn stuff, so I'm going to make sure that I write down specifically what I have learned each week. I might do that in the form of blog posts. They'll be like notes that happen to be publically avaiable. It'll also make it easier for me to review so I'm not always re-learning stuff. I'll also make sure to share what learning resources I used that week.

## Completed
A list of playable game prototypes released so far.
